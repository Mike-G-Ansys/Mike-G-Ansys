### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Mike-G-Ansys/Mike-G-Ansys** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pyAnsys and need to find a module in GitHub.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pretty much everything on here. :sweat_smile:
